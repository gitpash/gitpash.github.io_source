This is one of the FreeCodeCamp challenges to claim Front-End intermediate certificate. Include work with DarkSky API 

which could be found [Here][123]{:target="_blank"} and slightly touch [fetch request][fetch]{:target="_blank"} and [Response][linkid]{:target="_blank"} method. 
For some reason representing fully-functional bundle of html-css-js including fetched API and location manipulations causes weird post behaivior. So I just insert screenshot and provide a [Reference][codepen]{:target="_blank"}.
