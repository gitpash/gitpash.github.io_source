title: Develop first React-Based-App.
---

Now I'm working on FCC pojects for claiming the Front-End Certificate 

and figured out that almost all of them(projects) just 'copy-paste' version of provided for reverse engineering ones.
I wouldn't blame anyone, just think to myself how to implement actual 'code-standarts' for my projects. 
So the task is clear - just build a wikipedia viewer which will show articles and link you to the source. 
I've decided to implenemt this using React and [Axios](https://github.com/mzabriskie/axios){:target="_blank"} (with fetch, promises and Blackjack) for AJAX request(not bearded-jQuery-stuff)

[Watch in action](https://wikipsearch.herokuapp.com){:target="_blank"}.

Sourse code could be found [here](https://github.com/gitpash/Front-End-Dev-for-FCC/tree/master/Intermediate_Front-End/wiki-view){:target="_blank"}
